# Goal
Have a vue 2.7 host that remotes in vue 3 components in order to migrate away from vue 2.7.

The vue 2 host uses webpack with webpacks built in module federation, the vue 3 remotes will use vite with vite-plugin-federation, I've seen this appears to be possible based on: [This Example](https://github.com/originjs/vite-plugin-federation/tree/main/packages/examples/vue3-demo-webpack-esm-esm)
